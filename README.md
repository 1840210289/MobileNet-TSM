#  MobileNet-TSM

#### Description
This storehouse will provide all the codes using in Lightweight mobile network for real-time violence recognition for further researches, including  MobileNet-TSM and the software we developed.

#### Software Architecture
This code is based on the TSM codebase, https://hanlab.mit.edu/projects/tsm/

#### Installation

The code is built with following libraries:

PyTorch 1.9.0
TensorboardX
tqdm
scikit-learn


#### Instructions

1.  MobileNet-TSM
2.  Software

#### Contribution

1. We propose a lightweight network model MobileNet-TSM to meet the dual 48 requirements of accuracy and real-time for violence recognition.
2. We integrate the idea of temporal shift module, such that the original model can better extract the characteristic information of violent behavior, and further improve the accuracy of violence recognition.
3. We conducted several experiments on three commonly used violence recognition datasets: Hockey Fights, Crowd Violence and RWF-2000. We compared the advantages and disadvantages of the proposed method with those of the most advanced method in terms of accuracy, model parameters, and model size.
4. We deploy the trained model on the Android terminal and design a mobile app to show the application prospect of the method proposed in this study.
